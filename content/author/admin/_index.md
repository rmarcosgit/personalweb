I am a Geographer, interested in forest fire modeling and multiscale risk assessment.

I completed my PhD in Environmental and Land management at the University of Zaragoza in 2015. I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow (JdlC - Formaci√≥n) at the Department of Agricultural and Forest Engineering, Universityof LLeida.
I am also funding member of [RemOT-Technologies S.L.](https://remot-technologies.com/)
